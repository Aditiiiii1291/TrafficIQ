## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a virtual environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

### 2. Activate the virtual environment

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then activate again.

### 3. Install dependencies

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify the environment

```powershell
python --version
pip list
```

### 5. Run the Phase 2 OpenCV pipeline

Place a sample traffic video in `data/raw/`, then run:

```powershell
python ml/cv_pipeline.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --output data/processed/annotated_output.mp4
```

To export processed frames as JPG files:

```powershell
python ml/cv_pipeline.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --output data/processed/annotated_output.mp4 --frames-dir data/processed/frames
```

For a quick test on only the first 100 frames:

```powershell
python ml/cv_pipeline.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --output data/processed/annotated_output.mp4 --max-frames 100
```

To display processed frames in an OpenCV window:

```powershell
python ml/cv_pipeline.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --display
```

Press `q` to close the display window early.

### 6. Launch the Streamlit dashboard

After installing dependencies, run:

```powershell
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

## Vehicle Detection

Phase 3 uses YOLOv8n to detect the following COCO vehicle classes:

- `car`
- `motorcycle`
- `bus`
- `truck`

Ambulance-specific detection is handled separately by the Phase 4 ambulance detector so the generic vehicle detector stays focused on COCO vehicle classes.

### Run YOLOv8n Vehicle Detection

Place a sample traffic video in `data/raw/`, then run:

```powershell
python ml/detectors/vehicle_detector.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --output data/processed/vehicle_detection_output.mp4 --log data/logs/vehicle_detections.csv
```

For a quick CPU-friendly test:

```powershell
python ml/detectors/vehicle_detector.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --output data/processed/vehicle_detection_output.mp4 --log data/logs/vehicle_detections.csv --max-frames 100
```

To skip two frames after each processed frame:

```powershell
python ml/detectors/vehicle_detector.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --skip-frames 2
```

To adjust the confidence threshold:

```powershell
python ml/detectors/vehicle_detector.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --confidence 0.45
```

To display annotated frames:

```powershell
python ml/detectors/vehicle_detector.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --display
```

The reusable frame-level detector API is:

```python
annotated_frame, detections = detect_vehicles(frame)
```

The first YOLOv8n run may download `yolov8n.pt` if the weight file is not already available locally.

### Detection Log Format

Vehicle detections are written to CSV with these columns:

```text
source_video,frame_index,timestamp_seconds,class_id,class_name,confidence,xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax,box_width,box_height
```

Each row represents one detected vehicle in one processed frame.

## Ambulance Detection

Phase 4 adds ambulance detection infrastructure in `ml/detectors/ambulance_detector.py`.

This module is separate from the generic vehicle detector. It does not change the Phase 3 vehicle-only pipeline, and it does not claim ambulance detection accuracy until a real ambulance model and test dataset are evaluated.

### Ambulance Model Requirements

The ambulance detector expects a custom YOLO model trained or configured to detect ambulances.

Default model path:

```text
data/models/ambulance_detector.pt
```

You can override the model path with:

```powershell
python ml/detectors/ambulance_detector.py --ambulance-model data/models/custom_ambulance.pt --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4
```

Or set:

```powershell
$env:AMBULANCE_MODEL_PATH="data/models/custom_ambulance.pt"
```

If the model class names include `ambulance`, `emergency vehicle`, or `emergency_vehicle`, that class is used. If class metadata is unavailable, the detector assumes class ID `0`, which is common for single-class custom YOLO models.

### Reusable Ambulance API

```python
annotated_frame, ambulance_detections = detect_ambulances(frame)
```

Each ambulance detection uses this format:

```python
{
    "class_name": "ambulance",
    "confidence": 0.0,
    "bbox": [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax],
}
```

Emergency presence helper:

```python
is_emergency_present(ambulance_detections)
```

Returns `True` when at least one ambulance detection exists, otherwise `False`.

### Run Combined Vehicle and Ambulance Detection

```powershell
python ml/detectors/ambulance_detector.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --output data/processed/emergency_detection_output.mp4 --log data/logs/emergency_detections.csv --max-frames 100
```

To skip two frames after each processed frame:

```powershell
python ml/detectors/ambulance_detector.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --skip-frames 2
```

Expected output:

- Annotated output video at `data/processed/emergency_detection_output.mp4`
- Combined CSV log at `data/logs/emergency_detections.csv`
- Vehicle boxes from the generic vehicle detector
- Distinct ambulance boxes labeled `AMBULANCE`
- Frame-level status overlay showing `Emergency Vehicle: DETECTED` or `Emergency Vehicle: NONE`

### Combined CSV Log Format

Vehicle and ambulance detections use the same CSV columns:

```text
source_video,frame_index,timestamp_seconds,class_id,class_name,confidence,xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax,box_width,box_height
```

Ambulance rows use `class_name` set to `ambulance`.

## Traffic Density Analysis

Phase 5 adds traffic density analysis in `ml/analytics/density_analyzer.py`.

The analyzer consumes Phase 3 vehicle detections or count dictionaries and calculates:

- Total vehicle count
- Car count
- Motorcycle count
- Bus count
- Truck count
- Density level: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH`

It is independent of Streamlit and does not implement congestion prediction, emergency priority decisions, or traffic signal control.

### Density Thresholds

Default configurable constants:

```python
LOW_VEHICLE_THRESHOLD = 10
MEDIUM_VEHICLE_THRESHOLD = 25
```

Classification rules:

```text
LOW: total vehicles < 10
MEDIUM: total vehicles < 25
HIGH: total vehicles >= 25
```

### Reusable Density API

```python
density_result = analyze_density(vehicle_counts)
```

Example input:

```python
vehicle_counts = {
    "car_count": 10,
    "motorcycle_count": 4,
    "bus_count": 2,
    "truck_count": 2,
}
```

Example output:

```python
{
    "total_vehicles": 18,
    "car_count": 10,
    "motorcycle_count": 4,
    "bus_count": 2,
    "truck_count": 2,
    "density": "MEDIUM",
}
```

### Density Overlay

Use `draw_density_overlay(frame, density_result)` to add:

```text
Density: LOW
Density: MEDIUM
Density: HIGH
```

The overlay also displays the total vehicle count.

### Density Logging

Density logs are written with these columns:

```text
source_video,frame_index,timestamp_seconds,total_vehicles,car_count,motorcycle_count,bus_count,truck_count,density
```

Analyze an existing Phase 3 detection log:

```powershell
python ml/analytics/density_analyzer.py --detections-log data/logs/vehicle_detections.csv --output-log data/logs/density_analysis.csv
```

## Congestion Classification

Phase 6 adds congestion classification in `ml/analytics/congestion_classifier.py`.

The classifier consumes Phase 5 density results and maps them to congestion levels:

```text
LOW -> LOW_CONGESTION
MEDIUM -> MEDIUM_CONGESTION
HIGH -> HIGH_CONGESTION
```

It is a rule-based classification layer only. It does not implement machine learning prediction, a Streamlit dashboard, an emergency priority engine, or traffic signal control.

### Congestion Rules

Default configurable mapping:

```python
CONGESTION_RULES = {
    "LOW": "LOW_CONGESTION",
    "MEDIUM": "MEDIUM_CONGESTION",
    "HIGH": "HIGH_CONGESTION",
}
```

### Reusable Congestion API

```python
congestion_result = classify_congestion(density_result)
```

Example input:

```python
density_result = {
    "total_vehicles": 18,
    "density": "MEDIUM",
}
```

Example output:

```python
{
    "total_vehicles": 18,
    "density": "MEDIUM",
    "congestion": "MEDIUM_CONGESTION",
}
```

### Congestion Overlay

Use `draw_congestion_overlay(frame, congestion_result)` to add:

```text
Congestion: LOW_CONGESTION
Congestion: MEDIUM_CONGESTION
Congestion: HIGH_CONGESTION
```

### Congestion Logging

Congestion logs are written with these columns:

```text
timestamp,total_vehicles,density,congestion
```

Analyze an existing Phase 5 density log:

```powershell
python ml/analytics/congestion_classifier.py --density-log data/logs/density_analysis.csv --output-log data/logs/congestion_analysis.csv
```

## Emergency Priority Engine

Phase 7 adds a rule-based emergency priority engine in `ml/analytics/priority_engine.py`.

The engine consumes:

- Ambulance detection status
- Phase 5 density result
- Phase 6 congestion result

It generates simulated recommendation actions only. It does not implement real traffic signal control, hardware integration, a Streamlit dashboard, or machine learning prediction.

### Priority Actions

Supported actions:

```text
NORMAL_OPERATION
EXTEND_GREEN
HIGH_TRAFFIC_WARNING
EMERGENCY_PRIORITY
```

### Priority Rules

Default configurable rules:

```python
PRIORITY_RULES = {
    "emergency_present": "EMERGENCY_PRIORITY",
    "HIGH_CONGESTION": "HIGH_TRAFFIC_WARNING",
    "MEDIUM_CONGESTION": "EXTEND_GREEN",
    "LOW_CONGESTION": "NORMAL_OPERATION",
}
```

Rule behavior:

```text
Emergency vehicle present -> EMERGENCY_PRIORITY
High congestion -> HIGH_TRAFFIC_WARNING
Medium congestion -> EXTEND_GREEN
Otherwise -> NORMAL_OPERATION
```

### Reusable Priority API

```python
action_result = generate_priority_action(
    emergency_present,
    density_result,
    congestion_result,
)
```

Example output:

```python
{
    "emergency_present": True,
    "density": "HIGH",
    "congestion": "HIGH_CONGESTION",
    "recommended_action": "EMERGENCY_PRIORITY",
}
```

### Priority Overlay

Use `draw_priority_overlay(frame, action_result)` to add:

```text
Recommended Action: EMERGENCY_PRIORITY
```

### Priority Logging

Priority logs are written with these columns:

```text
timestamp,emergency_present,density,congestion,recommended_action
```

Generate recommendations from an existing Phase 6 congestion log:

```powershell
python ml/analytics/priority_engine.py --congestion-log data/logs/congestion_analysis.csv --output-log data/logs/priority_actions.csv
```

To simulate emergency-present recommendations for every row:

```powershell
python ml/analytics/priority_engine.py --congestion-log data/logs/congestion_analysis.csv --output-log data/logs/priority_actions.csv --emergency-present
```

## Streamlit Dashboard

Phase 8 adds the interactive dashboard in `frontend/app.py`.

The dashboard supports uploaded traffic videos in these formats:

```text
mp4
avi
mov
```

Dashboard sections:

- Traffic Overview
- Emergency Status
- Congestion Analysis
- Priority Recommendation

Status cards display:

- Vehicle Count
- Density
- Congestion
- Emergency Status
- Recommended Action
- Predicted Congestion

The dashboard connects to existing project modules:

- Vehicle detector
- Ambulance detector
- Density analyzer
- Congestion classifier
- Priority engine
- Congestion predictor

The ambulance detector is handled gracefully when a custom ambulance model is missing:

```text
Ambulance model not available. Using detection infrastructure only.
```

Launch command:

```powershell
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

The dashboard is still a simulated proof of concept. It does not implement FastAPI, hardware integration, or real traffic signal control.

After Phase 9, the dashboard can show `Predicted Congestion` when a trained model exists at:

```text
data/models/congestion_predictor.pkl
```

If the model has not been trained yet, the card shows:

```text
Model not trained
```

## Dataset Generation

Pre-Phase 9 adds dataset generation in `ml/prediction/dataset_builder.py`.

The builder converts historical logs into training-ready CSV files. It uses available outputs from:

- Vehicle detection
- Density analysis
- Congestion classification
- Priority engine

Generated training datasets are saved under:

```text
data/datasets/
```

Default output:

```text
data/datasets/congestion_training_dataset.csv
```

Generated feature list:

```text
timestamp
total_vehicles
car_count
motorcycle_count
bus_count
truck_count
density
congestion
emergency_present
recommended_action
```

Build a dataset from historical logs:

```powershell
python ml/prediction/dataset_builder.py --logs data/logs --output data/datasets/congestion_training_dataset.csv
```

If logs are missing or insufficient, the builder can create a small rule-consistent sample dataset so the ML pipeline can be tested. This sample is for pipeline validation only, not a real-world performance benchmark.

## Machine Learning Congestion Prediction

Phase 9 adds Scikit-Learn congestion prediction in `ml/prediction/congestion_predictor.py`.

Training features:

```text
total_vehicles
car_count
motorcycle_count
bus_count
truck_count
density
emergency_present
```

Target variable:

```text
congestion
```

Reusable APIs:

```python
train_model(...)
load_model(...)
predict_congestion(...)
```

Train a model:

```powershell
python ml/prediction/congestion_predictor.py --train data/datasets/congestion_training_dataset.csv
```

The trained model is saved to:

```text
data/models/congestion_predictor.pkl
```

Run a CLI prediction:

```powershell
python ml/prediction/congestion_predictor.py --predict --total-vehicles 18 --car-count 10 --motorcycle-count 4 --bus-count 2 --truck-count 2 --density MEDIUM
```

Training reports:

```text
accuracy
precision
recall
F1 score
```

Metrics are measured only on the available generated dataset and should not be presented as real-world traffic performance.

## Historical Analytics

Phase 10 adds historical analytics in `ml/analytics/history_analytics.py`.

The analytics module reads available CSV logs from:

- Vehicle detection
- Density analysis
- Congestion classification
- Priority engine

It generates:

- Vehicle count trends
- Density trends
- Congestion trends
- Emergency event frequency
- Recommendation frequency

Reusable APIs:

```python
generate_summary(...)
generate_trend_data(...)
generate_event_statistics(...)
```

Dashboard section:

```text
Historical Analytics
```

Dashboard charts:

- Vehicle count over time
- Density distribution
- Congestion distribution
- Recommendation distribution

Dashboard summary metrics:

- Total analyzed records
- Total emergency events
- Most common congestion level
- Most common recommendation

Dashboard filters:

- Date or timestamp prefix
- Congestion level
- Recommendation

Missing log files are handled gracefully. If no logs are available, the dashboard shows a message instead of failing.

CLI summary:

```powershell
python ml/analytics/history_analytics.py --logs data/logs
```

Export merged historical records:

```powershell
python ml/analytics/history_analytics.py --logs data/logs --export data/logs/history_summary.csv
```

Example summary output:

```python
{
    "total_analyzed_records": 9,
    "total_emergency_events": 3,
    "most_common_congestion_level": "MEDIUM_CONGESTION",
    "most_common_recommendation": "EMERGENCY_PRIORITY",
}
```

## Phase 11 Production Readiness

Phase 11 adds full production readiness to the AI Emergency Vehicle Priority System:

- **Logging Cleanup and Standardization**: Integrated structured logging with custom formatting across all pipelines and modules, utilizing standardized logger levels (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) and global configuration setups in all CLI executable scripts and the Streamlit app.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Added detailed try/except blocks to all CSV/data parsing, model load, prediction, and video iteration steps. Safe check fallbacks prevent dashboard crashes from missing files or malformed dataset records.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Fixed all imports and mock interfaces in the tests suite, bringing the total passing tests to 56/56.
- **Testing Verification**: Fully automated pytest suite covering congestion predictor pipeline, dataset generation, CV pipelines, density analyzer, congestion classifier, history analytics, and detectors.

### Phase 11 Testing Steps

   ```powershell
   pytest
   ```
2. Verify logging by running any of the CLI pipelines (e.g., helper):
   ```powershell
   python ml/detectors/vehicle_detector.py --help
   ```
