TrafficIQ is an AI-powered intelligent traffic management system that analyzes traffic videos, detects vehicles and emergency vehicles, estimates traffic density, classifies congestion, predicts congestion levels, and recommends simulated emergency priority actions through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

This project is a software simulation and analytics platform. It does not control real traffic lights, emergency infrastructure, IoT hardware, GPS systems, or siren/audio devices.

## Quick Start

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

## Why This Project

Emergency vehicles often lose critical time when traffic is dense, intersections are unmanaged, or operators lack timely visibility into congestion patterns. Even a short delay can matter when ambulances, fire vehicles, or emergency response units need a clear route.

This platform demonstrates how computer vision and traffic analytics can support smarter emergency-priority decisions in a controlled software environment. Uploaded traffic videos are converted into structured insights: vehicle counts, density levels, congestion categories, emergency vehicle status, historical trends, and a recommended priority action.

The project is intentionally scoped for portfolio and learning use. It focuses on the AI, analytics, and dashboard layers that would support a future intelligent traffic system, without claiming real-world signal control or safety-critical deployment readiness.

## Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Verify the environment:

```powershell
python --version
pip list
```

## Running The Dashboard

```powershell
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

Accepted upload formats:

```text
mp4
avi
mov
```

The dashboard analyzes a configurable frame sample for demo performance. Historical dataset generation remains separate from Streamlit and can use available CSV logs.

## Core CLI Workflows

Run the OpenCV pipeline:

```powershell
python ml/cv_pipeline.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --output data/processed/annotated_output.mp4 --max-frames 100
```

Run vehicle detection:

```powershell
python ml/detectors/vehicle_detector.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --output data/processed/vehicle_detection_output.mp4 --log data/logs/vehicle_detections.csv --max-frames 100
```

Run combined vehicle and ambulance detection:

```powershell
python ml/detectors/ambulance_detector.py --input data/raw/sample_traffic.mp4 --output data/processed/emergency_detection_output.mp4 --log data/logs/emergency_detections.csv --max-frames 100
```

```

Generate congestion logs:

```powershell
python ml/analytics/congestion_classifier.py --density-log data/logs/density_analysis.csv --output-log data/logs/congestion_analysis.csv
```

Generate priority recommendations:

```powershell
python ml/analytics/priority_engine.py --congestion-log data/logs/congestion_analysis.csv --output-log data/logs/priority_actions.csv
```

Build a training dataset:

```powershell
python ml/prediction/dataset_builder.py --logs data/logs --output data/datasets/congestion_training_dataset.csv
```

Train the congestion predictor:

```powershell
python ml/prediction/congestion_predictor.py --train data/datasets/congestion_training_dataset.csv
```

Run a CLI prediction:

```powershell
python ml/prediction/congestion_predictor.py --predict --total-vehicles 18 --car-count 10 --motorcycle-count 4 --bus-count 2 --truck-count 2 --density MEDIUM
```

Generate historical analytics:

```powershell
python ml/analytics/history_analytics.py --logs data/logs
```

## Data And Logs

CSV storage is used for initial development and portfolio demonstration.

Common output locations:

```text
data/logs/vehicle_detections.csv
data/logs/emergency_detections.csv
data/logs/density_analysis.csv
data/logs/congestion_analysis.csv
data/logs/priority_actions.csv
data/datasets/congestion_training_dataset.csv
data/models/congestion_predictor.pkl
```

## ML Model Explanation

The congestion prediction module uses Scikit-Learn and trains from generated historical datasets.

Training features:

```text
total_vehicles
car_count
motorcycle_count
bus_count
truck_count
density
emergency_present
```

Target variable:

```text
congestion
```

Evaluation metrics:

```text
accuracy
precision
recall
F1 score
```

Metrics should be interpreted only for the available dataset. They are not real-world traffic benchmarks.

## Testing

Run the automated test suite:

```powershell
pytest
```

Current validated project result:

```text
56 tests passing
```

Covered areas include:

- Density analysis
- Congestion classification
- Emergency priority engine
- Dataset generation
- Congestion prediction
- Detector helper behavior
- CV pipeline helpers
- Historical analytics

## Deployment

Current deployment target:

```powershell
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

This supports local Streamlit deployment for demos, screenshots, and project presentations.

Future deployment target:

- Render-hosted Streamlit app

Deployment is currently local only. No Render deployment, FastAPI backend, or production traffic infrastructure has been implemented.

## CI/CD Preparation

The repository prepares the following structure for future automation:

```text
.github/workflows/
```

No workflow YAML files are included yet. Future CI/CD support can add pytest validation, import checks, and dashboard startup checks after approval.

## Limitations

- Ambulance detection requires custom trained ambulance data and model weights for meaningful accuracy.
- The baseline detector uses YOLOv8n for CPU-friendly demonstration, not maximum detection performance.
- The prediction model is trained on limited generated or historical CSV data.
- The priority engine is rule-based and recommends simulated actions only.
- The project assumes a single-intersection or single-video analysis context.
- The dashboard samples frames for responsiveness during demos.
- CSV storage is suitable for early development but not large-scale production analytics.
- The project does not control real traffic lights or emergency infrastructure.
- No GPS, IoT, siren/audio detection, or hardware integration is included.

## Future Roadmap

Version 2 roadmap:

| Phase | Roadmap Item | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 17 | FastAPI Backend | Add an API layer for serving analytics and model predictions. |
| Phase 18 | ML Signal Recommendation Engine | Replace rule-only recommendations with trained decision support models. |
| Phase 19 | Advanced Dashboard | Add richer visualizations, scenario comparisons, and portfolio polish. |

These roadmap items are not implemented in the current repository.

## Project Status
Current status:

- Documentation and portfolio presentation upgraded
- Streamlit-first architecture
- No FastAPI backend yet
- CSV-first storage
- CPU-only target
- YOLOv8n baseline detector
- 96 automated tests passing
