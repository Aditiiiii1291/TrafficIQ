# TrafficIQ: AI-Powered Intelligent Traffic Management System

## Overview

### Problem Statement

Emergency vehicles such as ambulances often experience delays due to traffic congestion, increasing response times and potentially impacting patient outcomes.

Current traffic systems generally lack intelligent mechanisms for identifying emergency vehicles and dynamically prioritizing their movement through congested roads.

### Proposed Solution

Develop an AI-powered traffic monitoring system that:

* Detects ambulances in real-time using computer vision.
* Monitors and analyzes traffic density.
* Predicts short-term traffic congestion.
* Recommends traffic signal priority actions.
* Provides a real-time monitoring dashboard.

The system will simulate emergency vehicle prioritization and serve as a proof-of-concept for smart city traffic management.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives

* Detect ambulances from traffic camera footage.
* Estimate traffic density using vehicle counts.
* Predict near-future congestion levels.
* Generate priority recommendations for emergency vehicles.
* Display insights through an interactive dashboard.

### Secondary Objectives

* Maintain historical traffic records.
* Generate traffic analytics reports.
* Demonstrate integration of AI, ML, and real-time monitoring systems.

## Functional Requirements

### Ambulance Detection

The system shall identify ambulances in uploaded videos or live streams.

Outputs:

* Ambulance detected
* Confidence score
* Detection timestamp

---

### Vehicle Detection

Detect and classify:

* Car
* Bus
* Truck
* Motorcycle
* Ambulance

Outputs:

* Vehicle count
* Vehicle category count

---

### Traffic Density Estimation

Traffic levels:

| Vehicle Count | Density |
| ------------- | ------- |
| 0-10          | Low     |
| 11-25         | Medium  |
| 26+           | High    |

Output:

* Current traffic density

---

### Congestion Prediction

Inputs:

* Vehicle count
* Historical traffic data
* Time of day
* Day of week

Outputs:

* Predicted density
